// ####  Hashing --> 
		// It is A technique Used for Storing , Retrieving and Removing Information as quick as possible.
        
		// It is a Process of Converting a Arbitrary Size key into Fixed Sized Value.
		// The conversion is done via Special Function called as Hash Function.
		
		// Operations Supported by Hashing are:
		// Storing
		// Retrieving
		// Removing
		// Informations can be operated in Average Runtime Complexity Of O(1).
		
// ### Hash Function -->
		// A Hash Function Simply Takes an Arbitrary Size Key and Provides Fixed Size value also called as index.
		
// ### Modular Hash Function -->
		// A Modular Hash Function Simply Takes A key and Size , Returns Remainder by dividing key by size.
		// The Remainder is Used as an index to Store the key in an array of Provided Size.
		
		// Index = h(key) = key % size
		   // size = 10
